COVID-19_Tracker_APP

I created this app using Reactjs, Chartjs, Material UI, and a few other modules. This app also uses the following api to fetch data:

API: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Much thanks to JavaScript Mastery for the tutorial.

As a follow-up, I will make some changes of my own, such as adding a map showing which countries are infected and how many using a Google map api.
