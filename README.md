# COVID-19_Tracker_APP

## Description 
I was interested in keeping up-to-date with the number of cases of people who are infected, have recovered, and passed away from Covid-19, and wanted a direct way of accessing that information without having to scour the internet looking for it. Moreover, I wanted visualizations that are easy to see and understanding of this ongoing pandemic.

I created this app using Reactjs, Chartjs, Material UI, and a few other modules. This app also uses the following api to fetch data:

API: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Much thanks to JavaScript Mastery for the tutorial. I was fortunate enough to come across the video on Youtube, to follow-along, and am now making the project my own.

As a follow-up, I will make some changes of my own, such as adding a map showing which countries are infected and how many using a Google map api.
